# 📚 Binary Tree Java Project

This **Java** project demonstrates the implementation and manipulation of a **binary tree** data structure. The project provides an interactive menu to perform various operations such as traversals, finding the smallest element, counting nodes, and more.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is designed to provide a hands-on experience in dealing with binary trees using **Java**. The main functionality is encapsulated in a `Menu` class, allowing users to interact with the tree using a variety of options. 

### Key Features:
- Insertion of nodes
- Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order tree traversal
- Counting leaf nodes and total nodes
- Finding the minimum element in the tree
- Printing tree levels and finding the longest branch

## 🌟 Features

### 1. **Dynamic Node Insertion**
Users can insert nodes into the tree, ensuring it maintains binary tree properties.

### 2. **Tree Traversals**
Supports three traversal methods: **Pre-order**, **In-order**, and **Post-order**.

### 3. **Node Count**
Displays the total number of nodes in the tree.

### 4. **Height and Longest Branch**
Calculates the height of the tree and prints the longest branch.

### 5. **Leaf Nodes**
Finds the number of leaf nodes (nodes with no children).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary language used for implementing the binary tree and its operations.
- **Swing (JOptionPane)**: For the graphical user interface (GUI) to display menus and interact with the user.

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EmersonJPJ/Tree-in-java.git
    ```

2. Compile and run the program:
    ```bash
    javac Principal.java
    java Principal
    ```

3. Use the interactive menu to perform operations on the binary tree.

## ✨ Example of Interaction

When you run the program, you'll be presented with a menu that looks like this:

```
Menu Principal
1- Add Node
2- Show Tree
3- Pre-order Traversal
4- In-order Traversal
5- Post-order Traversal
6- Find Minimum Value
7- Print Leaves
8- Print Tree Levels
9- Get Tree Height
10- Count Nodes
11- Print Longest Branch
12- Exit
```

Each option lets you perform a specific action on the tree, making it easy to understand how the binary tree works interactively.

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- **Balanced Trees**: Implementing balanced trees (e.g., AVL, Red-Black Tree) to improve performance.
- **Error Handling**: Adding more advanced error handling and validation for inputs.
- **GUI Expansion**: Developing a more advanced graphical user interface to visualize the tree structure dynamically.

### 💡 **Inspiration**:
This project was inspired by common data structure learning exercises and aims to help in understanding the fundamentals of binary trees and recursive problem-solving in Java.
